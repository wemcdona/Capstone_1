Crunchylist
Crunchylist is a website used as a tracker for anime. It allows users to create a list of the anime they are watching by pulling data from the anime list of the Kitsu API and adding it to their own personal list. The website utilizes a database to store user lists and usernames.

Features
User Authentication: Users can sign up with an email, username, password, and an optional profile picture.
Profile Management: Users can edit their profile information.
Anime List Management: Users can add, view, and delete anime from their personal list.
Limited API: The available anime for adding and removing is limited due to the constraints of the Kitsu API.
