title of site: Crunchylist
Website is used a tracker for anime. It allows people to make a list of the anime that they are watching by pulling it from the anime list of the api, and adding it to their own personal list.
I chose to use a database in order for people to keep their lists in, as well as for the usernames of different users to be kept in as well. There is also the ability of somebody to edit their profile, add, and delete anime from their own personal list.
A user would go to the home page and press 'sign up' if they do not already have an account. From there they would submit an email, username, password, and an optional picture if they would like one for their profile. From here, the user can log into their own profile, where they can add anime to their own personal list from the in general list presented in front of them on their home page. From here they can click a link and travel to their own personal list for viewing. They can also delete anime from their own personal list as well.
The API that I found is limited on the anime you are able to add and subtract. I unfortunately couldn't find a free one with an extensive selection.
The project was made using html, css, python, flask, flaskwtf, and postgresql.
